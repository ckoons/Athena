# Athena Technical Documentation

## Overview

Athena is the knowledge graph system for the Tekton ecosystem. It manages entity relationships, provides reasoning capabilities, and enables structured knowledge representation and retrieval. Athena serves as the long-term memory and knowledge repository for the entire platform, allowing context-aware AI interactions across components.

## Architecture

Athena follows a layered architecture design with separation of concerns for maintainability and extensibility:

### 1. Storage Layer

The storage layer is responsible for graph data persistence and is designed with adaptability in mind:

- **Neo4j Integration**: Primary storage backend using the Neo4j graph database.
- **In-Memory Fallback**: Memory-based adapter with file persistence for development or when Neo4j is unavailable.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Consistent interface regardless of storage backend.
- **Hermes Integration**: Optional connection via Hermes database services.

### 2. Core Layer

The core layer implements the domain logic and business rules:

- **Knowledge Engine**: Central manager for knowledge graph operations.
- **Entity Management**: Handles creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of entities.
- **Relationship Management**: Manages connections between entities.
- **Query Engine**: Provides graph traversal and query capabilities.
- **Entity Merging**: Support for merging duplicate entities with confidence scores.

### 3. Integration Layer

The integration layer enables Athena to connect with other Tekton components:

- **Hermes Integration**: Service registration and discovery.
- **Engram Integration**: Memory synchronization.
- **Rhetor Integration**: LLM-powered entity extraction and relationship inference.
- **Tekton LLM Adapter**: Standardized LLM interface for AI-enhanced operations.

### 4. API Layer

The API layer exposes Athena's functionality via RESTful endpoints:

- **FastAPI Application**: Modern, high-performance web framework.
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Automatic request validation.
- **Exception Handling**: Consistent error responses.
- **Authentication**: Support for Tekton's authentication system.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of API abuse.
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time notifications and streaming responses.

### 5. UI Layer

The UI layer provides web-based interfaces for interacting with the knowledge graph:

- **Web Components**: Custom elements using the Web Components standard.
- **Graph Visualization**: Interactive visualization of the knowledge graph.
- **Knowledge-Enhanced Chat**: Chat interface with knowledge graph context.
- **Entity Management Interface**: CRUD operations on entities.
- **Query Builder**: Visual and textual graph query construction.

## Data Models

### Entity

Entities are nodes in the knowledge graph representing people, concepts, objects, etc.

```python
class Entity:
    """
    Represents a node in the knowledge graph.
    
    Entities are the primary unit of knowledge in Athena, representing
    people, concepts, objects, etc.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, 
                entity_id: Optional[str] = None, 
                entity_type: str = "generic", 
                name: str = "", 
                properties: Dict[str, Any] = None,
                confidence: float = 1.0,
                source: str = "system"):
```

Key Entity Features:
- Unique identifier
- Typed categorization
- Property dictionary with confidence scores
- Aliases for alternate names
- Provenance tracking (source attribution)
- Timestamping for creation and updates

### Relationship

Relationships are edges in the knowledge graph connecting entities.

```python
class Relationship:
    """
    Represents an edge in the knowledge graph.
    
    Relationships connect entities and provide structured knowledge about
    how entities relate to each other.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, 
                relationship_id: Optional[str] = None,
                relationship_type: str = "generic",
                source_id: str = "",
                target_id: str = "",
                properties: Dict[str, Any] = None,
                confidence: float = 1.0,
                source: str = "system"):
```

Key Relationship Features:
- Unique identifier
- Typed categorization (employs, contains, etc.)
- Directional or bidirectional connections
- Property dictionary with confidence scores
- Provenance tracking (source attribution)
- Timestamping for creation and updates

3. **Integration Issues**:
   - LLM failures: Check Rhetor service status, verify API keys
   - Engram synchronization: Check connection parameters, verify data models

## Conclusion

Athena provides a robust knowledge graph system for the Tekton ecosystem, enabling structured knowledge representation, retrieval, and reasoning. Its layered architecture, flexible storage adapters, and deep integration with other Tekton components make it a powerful tool for AI-enhanced software development.
